<!-- 
MAIN WEBPAGE IDEA: moviesaurus will be a netflix of black&white movies // you'll be able to see all b&w movies stored at moviedatabase api's. Orders: you'll generate an order depending on the movie you wish to see, then, our servers will find all the options and possible video hosting sites and will send you a resopnse with all the data it has found. Making kind of a google for 'renting' movies for free.
The tagword black and white.

BACKENDCONNECT:
- PASOS A SEGUIR:
[1] actualizar orders en backend: darle fecha de inicio y final.
- se debe mostrar de una order: si estÃ¡ activa o no. fecha inicio, y fecha final
[2] vista de admin: tiene acceso a los endpoints que necesita el isAdmin 
[3] develop header: token & no token view. 

FRONT:
- vistas a desarrollar:
  [1] profile
  [2] modify profile data
  [3] orders
  [4] new order

REGISTER: 
- divide Birthdate into 3 input fields so we get a full birthdate:
  

- make unable to see the form as an user, instead, let's show a funny phrase or the register order form, and so we use the same css' for it.


HOME: 
-  let's make a function that returns another view with the most popular movies and some other things below the login & background
-  home user: show a couple most watched b&w movies

COMPONENTS: 
-logout button animation fix
- create a button that activates the function 'sendData' to an endpoint depending on the user ID. example: user id = 7; if user ID = 7, then we will execute the endpoints with the admin pass and privileges. 
- we can also create a function that detects the kind of data we're sending and execute a function depending on this data itself. 

-- EXTERNAL THINGS --
- develop MOVIESAURUS logo / front page
- profile: be able to modify your own sidebar
    
EXTRA FOR FREE TIME:
[1] css & js animation all data fields at register go inside the register div and then it sends the data.
[2] develop further:
                        <BrowserRouter>
                              <Routes>
                                  <Route path="/" element={<Home/>}/>
                                  <Route path="/register" element={<Register/>}/>
                                  <Route path="/login" element={<Login/>}/>
                              </Routes>
                              
                              <Routes>
                                  <Route path="/register" element={<Home/>}/>
                                  <Route path="/login" element={<Register/>}/>
                                  <Route path="/" element={<Login/>}/>
                              </Routes>
                              <Footer/>
                              </BrowserRouter>
