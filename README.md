<!-- 
MAIN WEBPAGE IDEA: moviesaurus will be a netflix of black&white movies
BACKENDCONNECT:
- PASOS A SEGUIR:
[1] actualizar orders en backend: darle fecha de inicio y final.
- se debe mostrar de una order: si estÃ¡ activa o no. fecha inicio, y fecha final
[2] vista de admin: tiene acceso a los endpoints que necesita el isAdmin 
[3] develop header: token & no token view. 

FRONT:
- vistas a desarrollar:
  [1] profile
  [2] modify profile data
  [3] orders
  [4] new order
  [5] 
  [6]

REGISTER: 
- divide Birthdate into 3 input fields so we get a full birthdate 
- make unable to see the form as an user, instead, let's show a funny phrase or the register order form, and so we use the same css' for it.

HOME: 
-  let's make a function that returns another view with the most popular movies and some other things if you go into home as an user
-  home user: show a couple most watched b&w movies

COMPONENTS: 
- create a button that activates the function 'sendData' to an endpoint depending on the user ID. example: user id = 7; if user ID = 7, then we will execute the endpoints with the admin pass and privileges. 
- we can also create a function that detects the kind of data we're sending and execute a function depending on this data itself. 

-- EXTERNAL THINGS --
- develop MOVIESAURUS logo / front page
  
EXTRA FOR FREE TIME:
[1] css & js animation all data fields at register go inside the register div and then it sends the data.
